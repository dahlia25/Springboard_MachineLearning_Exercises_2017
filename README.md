# Springboard_MachineLearning_2017

All Machine Learning exercises are provided by Harvard's CS109 course through Springboard.

This repo consists of all the solutions I have come up with for the exercises.

These exercises contain the following:


    Linear Regression Models
    Prediction using linear regression
    Some re-sampling methods
        Train-Test splits
        Cross Validation
    Logistic Regression Models
        Grid Parameter CV Searches


The packages covered are: statsmodels, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
